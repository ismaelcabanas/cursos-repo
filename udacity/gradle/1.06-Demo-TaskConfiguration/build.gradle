/*
Now that we have some Groovy under our belts, we're in a much better position
to understand what's going on in a Gradle build script. Just like a closure
can have a delegate object, the entire build script delegates to a project
object. All the keywords in the Gradle DSL are properties of, or methods on,
the project object.
For instance, the project object has a method called `task` for declaring
tasks. It accepts a name of a new task and a configuration closure, which
we'll talk about shortly.
*/

project.task("myTask1")

/*
Since the entire build script delegates to `project`, we can leave that
off.
*/

task("myTask2")

/*
Because Groovy syntax is awesome, we can leave off the parentheses.
*/

task "myTask3"
